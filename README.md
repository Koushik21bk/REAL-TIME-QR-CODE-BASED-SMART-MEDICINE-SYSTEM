## Introduction
This project is an **Android-based QR Code Medicine Information System** that helps users scan QR codes on medicine packaging to retrieve crucial information about medications. The application also features a medicine reminder system, ensuring users never miss a dose. The app is built using Android Studio and integrates features such as real-time reminders and voice notifications to improve medication adherence, especially for elderly users.

## Problem Statement
Many people, especially the elderly, struggle to remember details about their medications, including dosage, side effects, and expiration dates. The existing methods of manually checking medication information are inefficient and often inaccurate. This project provides an automated system to scan QR codes and retrieve all necessary medication details, while also offering reminders for timely consumption.

## Objectives
- Develop an Android-based application that reads QR codes embedded on medicine packaging.
- Provide detailed information about medications including name, dosage, side effects, and expiration date.
- Enable daily reminders with voice notifications for regular medications.
- Allow users to set reminders for occasional (SOS) medications with alerts before expiration.

## Scope
This application is designed to:
- Help individuals easily retrieve medication information by scanning QR codes.
- Improve medication adherence by providing daily and SOS reminders.
- Reduce medication errors by offering accurate, timely details directly from the QR code.
- Store data related to the medicine in the QR code itself, ensuring that users can access all necessary details offline after scanning.

## Features
- **QR Code Scanning**: Scan QR codes on medicine packages to retrieve detailed information.
- **Regular Medication Reminder**: Set up daily reminders for regular medication.
- **SOS Medication Reminder**: Schedule reminders for occasional medications with alerts before expiration.
- **Voice Notifications**: Get voice-based notifications reminding you to take your medicine.
- **Medicine Information**: Retrieve information such as medication name, composition, dosage, and side effects.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Platform**: Android Studio
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL (for user and medicine information storage)
- **QR Code Scanning**: Android’s native camera and QR scanning APIs
- **Reminder & Notifications**: Android’s built-in notification manager
